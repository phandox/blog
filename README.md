# Personal blog project

Goal of this project is to create a personal blog site which is deployed on modern application technologies.
This project serve as learning experience for:
* Git
* Docker
* Automatic deployment
* Creating replicable environments for development
* Dev / Production parity
* Running application in cloud
* Continuous integration / Continuous deployment
* ...and of course blogging!

I will try to get exposure to Infrastructure as code principles and will try to blog about this whole journey from building infrastructure using open source tools I tend to hear a lot about. Hopefully I will have an web application, which is cloud-ready, automatically deployed when all the tests are successful and easily replicable on other machines to deploy in test environemnt.
