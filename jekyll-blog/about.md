Hello and welcome to my blog!

I've decided to create this site as a platform to show what I've learned, done and might be useful for others in world of IT. You will find posts about system administration, networking, infrastructure orchestration and automation and everything in between. I hope you will find the information here useful and maybe it will inspire you to also share your knowledge to the world!

The decision why I've chosen to create and maintain my own blog and not use the popular, already existing platforms have been driven by the fact that I would like to learn how to run Linux server as Docker host, how to create, operate, maintain and monitor containers, how to define the services using just the configuration manager and how to deploy the site using principles of Infrastructure as a Code. So at the first glance it looks like over-engineered static site, but I believe it can provide a nice introduction into this area and it is not hidden somewhere in the lab where only the creator has access. Everything used for this blog is hosted in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phandox/blog), so feel free to view the content, provisioning and deployment scripts.
